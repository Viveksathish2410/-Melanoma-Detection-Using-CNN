# Melanoma-Detection-Using-CNN
The project is about the detection of one of the deadliest skin cancer Melanoma.

We use DeepLearning model CNN(Convolutinal Neural Network) to predict the image is a melanoma or benign(not a cancer).

By using the CNN model we increase the accuracy of the prediction 

We test and train the dataset and make it more efficient
